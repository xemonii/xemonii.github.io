            <p><i>Five Night's At Freddy's</i> is a point-and-click survival horror game where you play the role of a security guard at a local pizzeria, you are 
            tasked to survive five nights as the animatronic performers roam around. This game has been a certified classic since it's release in 2014, followed by eight other games,
            book series, and a possible movie in 2023. It is for certain that this game is very successful and popular among users of all ages and genders, and it's
            talented fanbase has likely created the most fan games for the franchise than any other game. <i>Five Night's At Freddy's</i> mostly utilizes suspense
            and jumpscares to scare its players, and the gameplay consisted of sitting in a room, pressing buttons, and using tools such as cameras to make sure
            that you are safe, other games in the franchise have had a similar premise up until recent games; such as <i>Security Breach.</i> Although the community
            has faced some challenges and the games have lost their dreadful suspense over the years, the charm still stays the same.</p>

                The game was developed and published by <i>Scott Cawthon</i>, a former video game developer and writer from Houston, Texas. Cawthon has made some
                other games in his time, such as <i>The Desolate Hope</i> and <i>There Is No Pause Button!</i>, and one game in particular, <i>Chipper & Son's Lumber Co</i>,
                was massively critizied; saying that the characters look scary and resemble animatronics. Cawthon was about to give up being a game developer until 
                that one comment struck the right chord, and thus, <i>Five Nights At Freddy's</i> was born. The first game was released back in August 8, 2014, followed by
                <i>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</i> in the same year and <i>Five Nights At Freddy's 3</i> in 2015, which have similar gameplay and an expansion in the game's 
                unsolved lore. <i>Five Nights At Freddy's 4</i> was released later that year, in which things started to take a turn with the gameplay, lore, and many
                new characters were starting to make their appearance. In 2016, new features came along with <i>Five Nights At Freddy's: Sister Location</i> and
                <i>Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator</i> in 2016 and 2017 respectively, at which point, things were finally starting to die down.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cawthon had also written and published many books for the franchise, such as the novel trilogy back in 2015 to 2018, named <b>The Silver Eyes, 
                The Twisted Ones</b>, and <b>The Fourth Closet.</b> Although the novels weren't canon to the lore of the games, it was considered a sort of contuinity.
                Cawthon then proceeded to make other short story series such as <b>Fazbear Frights</b> and <b>Tales From The Pizzaplex,</b> and we're still expecting
                some more books in the coming years.
            </p>

            <p>
                But the game series isn't quite done yet. In 2018, Cawthon released Ultimate Custom Night, where he squeezed in over 50 of the franchise's characters in 
                what can only be an amalgamation of the offices from previous games. Later on, Cawthon went on to release a Virtual- and Augmented Reality game,
                <i>Five Nights At Freddy's: Help Wanted</i> and <i>Five Nights At Freddy's: Special Delivery,</i> respectively. Finally,
                <i>Five Nights At Freddy's: Security Breach</i> was published in 2021, the final game to be released but not necessarily the last game in the franchise;
                the gameplay differs from other games, having one night instead of five and including free-roam. The pressure of the release also lead it to have many
                bugs and likely one of the largest patch notes of all time, but in turn, reunited the community once more.
